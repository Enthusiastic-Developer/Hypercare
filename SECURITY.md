# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Do not open an issue or file a pull request on the public repository.**

2. Email the security team privately at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours acknowledging your email.

3. Provide details of the vulnerability, including information about the environment, reproduction steps, and any potential impact.

4. If the security team confirms the vulnerability, they will collaborate with you to address the issue and determine an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Security Controls

Our project follows security best practices and has implemented various controls:

### Threat Modeling

We conduct regular threat modeling sessions to identify and mitigate potential security threats throughout the development lifecycle.

### Continuous Monitoring

We employ continuous monitoring tools to detect and respond to security events in real-time.

### Security Training

Developers and team members receive ongoing security training to stay informed about the latest threats and best practices.

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident, we have a robust incident response process in place:

1. **Detection:** Detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

2. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems and prevent further damage.

3. **Eradication:** Remove the root cause of the incident.

4. **Recovery:** Restore affected systems and services.

5. **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a thorough review to learn from the incident and improve our security posture.
